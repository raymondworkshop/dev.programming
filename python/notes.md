#### TODO  
* modules  
    - modules as abstraction layers to **separate code into parts**  
    - python interpreter search for models **in the "path"** recursively 
        + the included code is isolated in **a module namespace**, and neednot worry the included codde have unwanted effects  

    - group modules together in a package  

* namespace control 

* pure functions  
    - more efficient building blocks than classes and objects 
    with **no context or side-effects** 
    - easier to test with unit tests    
   
* class 

#### notes  
*  do more coding  
*  make writing the programs a more **intuitive** task  

#### Python Data Model - A Framework/API for core language constructs

Python interpreter invokes special methods to perform basic object operations.

By using and implementing special methods of Python Data Model in your objects, your objects can **behave like the built-in types**, enabling the expressive coding style **Pythonic**.

#### Data Sturctures
* sequences  
  Python sequences are often categorized as **mutalbe or immutable**, and also could be considered as **flat sequences and container sequences**. 
    - list -> mutable and mixed-type
    - array
  
* mappings  
* sets
* str versus bytes  

* Variables are mere labels  
    - the parameters in the function are **aliases** of the actual arguments  

#### Functions as objects  

* Decorators and Closures  
    - 

#### Object Oriented

#### Control flow  


#### Metaprogramming
