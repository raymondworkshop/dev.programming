"""
OOP is well-suited to programs that model systems that have **separate but interacting parts** 

like, different users interact in a social network, diff characters interact in a game, and diff shapes interact in a physical simulation

When representing such system, the objects in a program often **map naturally onto objects** in the system being modeled, 
and **classes represent their types and relationships**
