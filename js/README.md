#### notes  
* data structures  
    - num, booleans, strings are the atoms  
        + immutable and cannot be changed  

    - arrays and objects are used to group values into a single value  
        + arrays  - sequence of values  
        + objects - dict  
            + reference  - binding 
            + mutable  

* JSON  
    

* abstraction  
    - function 
        

* JS Function is a value **representing an "action"**  

* object is stored and copied "by **reference**",
while primitive values: strings, numbers, booleans, etc are copied "as a whole value"  

* class  
    - in JS, a class is a kind of function  
    - a class is an **extensible program-code-template** for creating objects,
    providing init values for state (variables) and implementations of behavior (functions)
