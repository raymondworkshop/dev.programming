### note on how to design programs 

#### Data  
* design functions  
    - information (domain)  <=>  Data  (program)  <=> information (domain)

    - data definitions  
        + how to represent input information as data  

    - domain knowledge  
        + work with domain experts 
        + library functions  

#### systematic program design  
* problem analysis 
    - **what is relevant in the problem statement** and what can be ignored 
    - whether the chosen language and its libraries **provide certain operations** for the data, or we might develop auxiliary functions for the operations


* **design recipe**  offers a step-by-step process  in a systematic manner  
  with a way of **organizing programs around problem data**  
    - **formulate data definitions** - Indentify the information that must be represented  
    - **state what kind of data** the desired function consumes and produces  
    
    - functional examples - illustrate the function's purpose from examples  
    
    - function template - translate the data definitions into an outline of the function  
    
    - testing

* iterative refinement  
    - strip away all inessential details and **find a solution for  the remaining core problem**   
    - **A refinement step adds in one of the omitted details and re-solves the expanded problem**  
    - An iteration of the refinement steps eventually leads to a complete solution  



* **interactive products** 
    - creating software provides immediate feedback and  thus leads to exploration,
experimentation, and self-vealuation


### notes on compiler  
* scheme 
  
* about meta-circular evaluator and compiler 


#### experiment  
* fix the issue - cannot display the image to use 2htdp/image directly
