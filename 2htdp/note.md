### note on how to design programs 


#### systematic program design  
* **design recipe**  
    - **formulate data definitions** - Indentify the information that must be represented  
    - **state what kind of data** the desired function consumes and produces  
    
    - functional examples - illustrate the function's purpose from examples  
    
    - function template - translate the data definitions into an outline of the function  
    
    - testing

* iterative refinement  
    - strip away all inessential details and **find a solution for  the remaining core problem**   
    - **A refinement step adds in one of the omitted details and re-solves the expanded problem**  
    - An iteration of the refinement steps eventually leads to a complete solution  

* **interactive products** 
    - creating software provides immediate feedback and  thus leads to exploration,
experimentation, and self-vealuation


### notes on compiler  
* scheme 
  
* about meta-circular evaluator and compiler
