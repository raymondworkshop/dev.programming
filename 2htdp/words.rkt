; TODO - 12.3 Word Games, Composition Illustrated 
; Problem - Given a word, find all words that are made up
;  from the same letters. like "cat" also spells "act"
;
; note: we proceed systematically and start by choosing a data representation
;      for our inputs and outputs 
;

;  1.  problem analysis -> data definition 
;      represent words as strings, and the result as a list of words 
;
;  2.  formulate a signature and purpose statement
;  string -> list-of-strings  
;  find all words that use the same letters as s
;
;   compose two part
;      - rearrangement words 
;      - check in dictionary 
(define (alternative-words s) 
  (list->string (rearrangement (string->list s))))
;(define (arrangements s) s)
;    list-of-strings -> list-of-strings
;     picks out all those Strings that occur in the dictionary
;     TODO - use WordNet  
;(define (in-dictionary los) '())

;
;  3.  example -> examples and tests 
(require test-engine/racket-tests)
;     word representation - strings or list-of-letters?
;(check-member-of (alternative-words "cat") 
;                 (list "act" "cat")
;                 (list "cat" "act"))
;  note: view words as list of letters is better 
;  TODO - TESTS FAILED
